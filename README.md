# Mandelbrot Fractal Image Generator in C++

This project generates Mandelbrot fractals using C++. It's built to create visual representations of the Mandelbrot set.

### Running the Program

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as Code Blocks.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Upon execution, the program generates an output image named `Image.bmp`.


## Customization

Feel free to experiment with the RGB values or fractal parameters within the code to create diverse and unique Mandelbrot fractal images.


## Output Image

The repository includes the `Output.bmp` file, showcasing a generated Mandelbrot fractal.
